[**Documentation**](https://activitywatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Client library for ActivityWatch in Python.

Please see the documentation for usage and examples.


## How to install

To install the latest git version directly from github without cloning, run
`pip install git+https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-client.git`

To install from a cloned version, cd into the directory and run
`poetry install` to install inside an virtualenv. If you want to install it
system-wide it can be installed with `pip install .`, but that has the issue
that it might not get the exact version of the dependencies due to not reading
the poetry.lock file.

## Usage

For the CLI:

```
$ aw-client --help
Usage: aw-client [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

## Debugging

* Run python with `LOG_LEVEL=debug` to get additional debugging output
* If invalid events have been queued for submission, you may need to delete the file-based queues generated by this library
* To use the development version of this library use `aw-client = {path = "../aw-client" }` in `pyproject.toml`

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains a couple of example scripts, including:

 - `time_spent_today.py` - fetches all non-afk events and sums their duration to get the total active time for the day.
 - `merge_buckets.py` - merges two buckets with non-intersecting events by moving all events from one into the other.
 - `redact_sensitive.py` - redact sensitive events.
